# Types, Variables, Operators

## Introduction to Java

- "Most popular" language

- Runs on a "virtual machine" (JVM)

- More complex than some

- Simpler than others

<!--more-->

### Compile

Source Code(.java) -> javac -> Byte Code(.class) -> java

```java
class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Program execution begins here
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
```

so the program structure is:

```java
class ClassName {
    // class body
}
```

- `class` is a keyword
- `ClassName` is the name of the class
- `{}` is the body of the class

## Types

- `boolean`: Truth value

- `int` : Integer number

- `double` : Read number

- `String` : Text

## Variables

Named location that stores a value of one particular type

Form: `TYPE NAME`

## Operators

- Assignment `=`

- Addition `+`

- Subtraction `-`

- Multiplication `*`

- Division `/`

- Modulus `%`

Order of operations follow standard math rules;

1. Parentheses

2. Multiplication and Division

3. Addition and Subtraction

```java
class DoMath {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double result = 1.0 + 2.0 * 3.0;
        System.out.println(result);
        result = result / 2.0;
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
```

## String Concatenation (+)

```java
String text = "hello" + "world";
text = text + "number" + 5;
System.out.println(text);
// text = "hello world number 5"
```

# More types, methods, conditionals

## More types

### Division

Division `/` operates differently on integers and on doubles

Example

```java
double a = 5.0 / 2.0; // a = 2.5
int b = 4 / 2; // b = 2
int c = 5 / 2; // c = 2
double d = 5 / 2; // d = 2.0
```

Order of Operations

Precedence like math, left to right. 

Right hand side of = evaluated first

Parenthesis increase precedence

## Methods

```java
public static void NAME() {
    // STATEMENTS;
}
```

To call a method: `NAME();`

### Parameters

```java
public static void NAME(TYPE NAME) {
    // STATEMENTS;
}
```

To call: `NAME(EXPRESSION);`

```java
[...] NAME(TYPE NAME, TYPE NAME) {
    // STATEMENTS;
}
```

To call: `NAME(arg1, arg2);`

### Variable Scope

Variables live in the block `{}` where they are defined (**scope**)

Method parameters are like defining a new variables in the method

Methods: Building Blocks

- Big programs are built out of small methods

- Methods can be individually developed, tested and reused

- Use of method does not need to know how it works

- In Computer Science, this is called "abstraction"

## Conditionals

### if statement

```java
if (CONDITION) {
    // STATEMENTS;
}
```

### Comparison operators

```java
x == y
x != y
x < y
x <= y
x > y
x >= y
```

### Boolean operators

```java
&& // AND
|| // OR
! // NOT
```

# Loops and arrays

## Good programming style

<span style="color:orange; text-decoration: underline;">***The goal of good style is to make your code more readable by you and others.***</span>

- Use good names for variables and methods

- Use indentation

- Add whitespaces

- Don't duplicate tests

## Loops

Loop operators allow to loop through a block of code

### The while loop

```java
while (CONDITION) {
    // STATEMENTS;
}
```

Count carefully

Make sure that your loop has a chance to finish

### The for loop

```java
for (INITIALIZATION; CONDITION; INCREMENT) {
    // STATEMENTS;
}
```

`break` terminates a `for` or `while` loop immediately

`continue` skips the current iteration of a loop and proceeds directly to the next iteration

### Embedded loops

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
        System.out.println(i + " " + j);
    }
}
```

Scope of the variable defined in the initialization: respective for block

### Arrays

An array is an indexed list of values. All elements of an array must have the same type.

The index starts at <span style="color:red; text-decoration: underline;">zero</span> and ends at <span style="color:red; text-decoration: underline;">length - 1</span>

An array is defined using `TYPE[]`

To create an array of a given size, use the operator `new`

```java
int[] values = new int[5];
int[] values = new int[size];
```

#### Array initialization

Curly braces can be used to initialize an array. It can <span style="color:red;">ONLY</span> be used when you declare the variable

```java
int[] values = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
```

#### Accessing Arrays

To access the elemtns of an array, use the `[]` operator `values[index]`

Each array has a `length` variable built-in that contains the length of the array

# Objects and classes

## Object oriented programming

Objects group together

- Primitives

    - `int`

    - `double`

    - `chat`

    - etc...

- Objects

    - `String`

    - etc...

## Defining Classes

Class Definition

```java
public class Baby {
    String name;
    boolean isMale;
    double weight;
    double decibels;
    int numPoops = 0;

    void poop() {
        numPoops += 1;
        System.out.println("Oops!");
    }
}
```

Class Instance

```java
Baby myBaby = new Baby();
```

- Class names care Capitalized

- 1 Class = 1 file

- Having a `main` method means the class can be run

### Constructors

- Constructor name == the class name

- No return type - never returns anything

- Usually initialize fields

- All classes need at least one constructor

    - If no constructor defined, defaults to

    ```java
    ClASSNAME() {}
    ```

## Using Classes

Accessing fields

- Object.FIELDNAME

Calling methods

- Object.METHODNAME([ARGS])

## Reference v.s. Values

### Primitives v.s. References

- **Primitive** types are basic java types

    - int, long, double, boolean, char, short, byte, float

    - The actual **values** are stored in the variable

- **Reference** types are arrays and objects

    - String, int[], Baby, etc...

Variables are like fixed size cups in primitivs, which are small enough that they just fit into cup

Objects are too big to fit in a variable, so they are stored somewhere else in memory, and the variable stores a number that locates the object

### Reference

The object's location is called a **reference**

- using `[]` or `.`

    - Follows the reference to the object

    - May modify the object, but never the reference

- Imagine

    - Following directions to a house

    - Moving the furniture around

- Analogous to

    - Following the reference to an object

## Static types and methods

### Static

- Applies to fields and methods

- Means the field / method

    - Is defined for the class declaration

    - Is not unique for each instance

It keeps track of the number of babies that have been made in static field

Non-static methods can reference static methods, but not the other way around

`main()` is used to run the program rather than change the program, so it is static

# Access control, class scope, packages, Java API

## Access control

### Public v.s. Private

- Public: others can use this

- Private: only the class can access it

public/private applies to any **field** or **method**

The reason to access control:

- Protect private information (sorta)

- Clarify how others should use your class

- Keep implementation separate from interface

## Class scope

Just like methods, variables are accessible inside `{}`

### `this` keyword

- Clarifies scope

- Means 'my project'

```java
public class Baby {
    int servings;
    void feed() {
        this.servings += servings;
    }
    void poop() {
        System.out.println("Oops!");
        this.servings -= 0;
    }
}
```

## Packages

- Each class belongs to a package

- Classes in the same package serve a similar purpose

- Packages are just directories

- Classes in other packages need to be imported

### Defining and using packages

- Define a package using `package`

```java
package path.to.package.foo;
class Foo {

}
```

- Use a package using `import`

```java
import path.to.package.foo.Foo;
import path.to.package.foo.*;
```

By using packages, we can

- Combine similar functionality

    - org.london.libraries.Library

    - org.london.libraries.Book

- Separate similar names

    - shopping.List

    - packing.List

### Special packages

All classes "see" classes in the same package (no need to import)

All classes "see" classes in java.lang

## Java API

Java includes lots of packages/classes

Reuse classes to avoid extra work

### ArrayList

Modifiable list

Internally implemented with arrays

Features

- Get/put items by index

- Add items

- Delete items

- Loop over all items

### Sets

Like an `ArrayList` but 

- Only one copy of each object, and

- No array index

Features

    - Add objects to the set

    - Remove objects from the set

    - Is an object in the set

TreeSet: Sorted (lowest to highest)
HashSet: Unordered(pseudo-random)

### Maps

Stores a (*key*, *value*) pair of objects

Look up the value by the *key*, get back the value

# Design, debugging, interfaces

## Good program design

- Correct / no errors

- Easy to understand

- Easy to modify / extend

- Good performance (speed)

### Step 1. Don't Make Mistakes

Don't introduce errors in the first place

- Reuse: find existing code that does what you want

- Design: think before you code

- Best Practice: Recommended procedures / techniques to avoid common problems

#### Design

A high-level, understandable description of what a program is supposed to do

Don't worry about the details, worry about the structure

Visual design for objects, or how a program works

### Step 2. Find Mistakes Early

Easier to fix errors the earlier you find them

- Test your design

- Tools: detect potential errors

- Test your implementation

- Check your work: assertions

#### Tools : Eclipse Warnings

Warnings: may not be a mistake, but it likely is

Suggestion: always fix all warnings

Extra checks: FindBugs and related tools

Unit testing: JUnit makes testing easier

### Step 3. Reproduce the Error

- Figure out how to repeat the error

- Create a minimal test case

Go back to a working version and introduce changes one at a time until the error coms back

Eliminate extra stuff that isn't used

### Step 4. Generate Hypothesis

What is going wrong?

What might be causing the error?

### Step 5. Collect Information

If x is the problem, how can we verify? Need information about what is going on inside the program

`System.out.println()` is very powerful

### Step 6. Examine Data

Examine your data

Is your hypothesis correct? Fix the error, or generate a new hypothesis  

#### Use Methods

Write and test code once, use it multiple times: avoid duplication

Use it without understanding how it works: **encapsulation / information hiding**

#### Use Objects

Objects combine a related set of variables and methods

Provide a simple *interface*

## Interfaces

Manipulate objects, without knowing how they work

Useful when you have similar but not identical objects

Useful when you want to use code written by others

Set of classes that share methods

Declare an *interface* with the common methods

Can use the interface, without knowing an object;s specific type

# Inheritance, exceptions, file I/O

## Inheritance

```java
public class Dude {
    public String name;
    public int hp = 100;
    public int mp = 0;

    public void sayName() {
        System.out.println(name);   
    }

    public void punchFace(Dude target) {
        target.hp -= 10;
    }
}
```

Now consider a `Wizard` class by Inheritance

```java
public class Wizard extends Dude {}
```

- Wizard can use everything* the Dude has

```java
wizard.hp += 1;
```

- Wizard can do everything* Dude can do

```java
wizard.punchFace(dude);
```

- Can use a Wizard like a Dude too

```java
dude.punchface(wizard);
```

everything* except for **private** fields and methods

***<u>You can only inherit from one class</u>***

## Exceptions

- NullPointerException

- ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

- ClassCastException

- RuntimeException

Exception : Event that occurs when something "unexpected" happens

We can use an exception to tell the code using our method that something went wrong. Debugging and understanding control flow.

## I/O

### InputStream

- InputStream is a stream of bytes

    - Read one byte after another using `read()`

- A byte is just a number

    - Data on your hand drive is stored in bytes

    - Bytes can be interpreted as characters, numbers, etc...

### InputStreamReader

- Reader is a class for character streams

    - Read one character after another using `read()`

- InputStreamReader takes an InputStream and converts bytes to characters

- Still inconvenient

    - Can only read a character at a time

### BufferedReader

- BufferedReader buffers a character stream so you can read line by line

### FileReader

- FileReader takes a text file

    - converts it into a character stream

    - FileReader (`"Path/to/file"`)

Use this + BufferedReader to read a file
