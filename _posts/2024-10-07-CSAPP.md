# Overview

## Great Reality #1

`Ints` are not integers, `Floats` are not reals

Is $x^2 \geq 0$ for all $x$?

`Float`'s: Yes!

`Int`'s:

<!--more-->

```bash
lldb
(lldb) print 40000 * 40000
(int) 1600000000
(lldb) print 50000 * 50000
(int) -1794967296
```

Because this computer is expecting numbers to be represented in 32-bit values and the bit pattern that you get when you do this multiplication happens to be the representation of a negative number.

```bash
(lldb) print 300*400*500*600
(int) 1640261632
(lldb) print 400*500*600*300
(int) 1640261632
```

No matter what order you do the multiplication in, you get the same result. This integer arithmetic is always associative and commutative.

Is $(x+y)+z = x+(y+z)$ for all $x,y,z$?

Unsigned & Signed `Int`s: Yes!

`Float`'s:

```bash
(lldb) print (1e20+ -1e20) + 3.14
(float) 3.1400000000000001
(lldb) print 1e20+(-1e20+3.14)
(float) 0
```

It is not associative. It all comes down to the fact that they use finite representations of things that are potentially infinite in their expanse.

### Computer Arithmetic

- Does not generate random values

- Arithmetic operations have important mathematical properties

- Cannot assume all "usual" mathematical properties

- Due to finite representation

- Integer operations satisfy *ring* properties

    - Commutativity, associativity, distributivity

- Floating point operations satisfy *ordering* properties

    - Monotonicity, values of signs

## Great Reality #2

Got to know assembly

- Compiler are much better & more patient than you are

- Understanding assembly is key to machine-level execution model

- Behavior of programs in presence of bugs

- Tuning program performance

- Implementing system software

- Creating / fighting malware

## Great Reality #3

Memory matters

Random access memory is an unphysical abstraction

- Memory is not unbounded

- It must be allocated and managed

- Many applications are memory dominated

- Memory referencing bugs especially pernicious

- Effects are distant in both time and space

- Memory performance is not uniform

- Cache and virtual memory effects can greatly affect program performance

- Adapting program to characteristics of memory system can lead to major speed improvements

```c
typedef struct {
    int a[2];
    double d;
} struct_t;

double fun(int i) {
    volatile struct_t s;
    s.d = 3.14;
    s.a[i] = 1073741824; /* Possibly out of bounds */
    return s.d;
}
```

fun(0) -> 3.14

fun(1) -> 3.14

fun(2) -> 3.1399998664856

fun(3) -> 2.00000061035156

fun(4) -> 3.14

fun(6) -> Segmentation fault

value | index
--- | ---
Critical State | 6
? | 5
? | 4
d7 ... d4 | 3
d3 ... d0 | 2
a[1] | 1
a[0] | 0

`struct_t` is contained the index from 0 to 3. Basically the two if each of these blocks in this vertical chain represents four bytes. So the two elements of a each are two bytes. And then the double d is 8 bytes. If reference either `a[0]` or `a[1]` then will just modify that array as designed. But when call `fun(2)` or `fun(3)`, what actually do is altering the bytes that encode this number 'd'

### Memory referencing errors

- C and C++ do not provide any memory protections

- Out of bounds array reference

- Invalid pointer dereference

- Abuses of malloc/free

- Can lead to nasty bugs

- Whether or not bug has any effect depends on system and compiler

- Action at a distance

    - Corrupted object logically unrelated to one being accessed

    - Effect of bug may be first observed long after it is generated

<span style="color:red; text-decoration: underline;">***That exists on earth is to try and figure out memory referencing errors***</span>

## Great Reality #4

There's more to performance than asymptotic complexity

- Constant factors matter too

- And even exact op count does not predict performance

- Understand system to optimize performance

```c
void copyij(int src[2048][2048], int dst[2048][2048]) {
int i, j;
for (i = 0; i < 2048; i++)
    for (j = 0; j < 2048; j++)
        dst[i][j] = src[i][j];
} // 4.3ms

void copyji(int src[2048][2048], int dst[2048][2048]) {
int i, j;
for (j = 0; j < 2048; j++)
    for (i = 0; i < 2048; i++)
        dst[i][j] = src[i][j];
} // 81.8ms
```

## Great Reality #5

Computers do more than execute programs

- They need data to get in and out

- I/O system critical to program reliability and performance

- They communicate with each other over networks

# Bits, Bytes, and Integers

Everything is bits

- Each bit is 0 or 1

- By encoding / interpreting sets of bits in various ways

- Electronic Implementation

0 | 1
--- | ---
0.0 - 0.2v | 0.9 - 1.1v

The reason why bits are important is in the digital world, you can sort of take what otherwise an analog signal and quantify it.

## Representing information as bits

- Byte is 8 bits

- Binary $00000000$ to $11111111$

- Decimal $0$ to $255$

- Hexadecimal $00$ to $FF$

    - Write $FA1D37B$ in `C` as $0xFA1D37B$

Hex | Decimal | Binary
--- | --- | ---
0 | 0 | 0000
1 | 1 | 0001
2 | 2 | 0010
3 | 3 | 0011
4 | 4 | 0100
5 | 5 | 0101
6 | 6 | 0110
7 | 7 | 0111
8 | 8 | 1000
9 | 9 | 1001
A | 10 | 1010
B | 11 | 1011
C | 12 | 1100
D | 13 | 1101
E | 14 | 1110
F | 15 | 1111

### Example Data Representation

C Data Types \ (bytes) | 32-bit | 64-bit | x86-64
--- | --- | --- | ---
char | 1 | 1 | 1
short | 2 | 2 | 2
int | 4 | 4 | 4
long | 4 | 8 | 8
float | 4 | 4 | 4
double | 8 | 8 | 8
long double | - | - | 10/16
pointer | 4 | 8 | 8

Any address is defined to be the sort of the word size of the machine

## Bit-level manipulations

### Boolean Algebra

Encode `TRUE` as `1` and `FALSE` as `0`

Operations: `&` AND, `|` OR, `~` NOT, `^` XOR

#### Aside

**XOR** is that the if you have two inputs that are different, the output is `1`. If they're the same, the output is `0`.

### Representing & Manipulating Sets

- Representation 

- Width $w$ bit vector represent subsets of $\{0, ..., w-1\}$

- $a_j = 1$ if $j$ in set $A$

    - e.g. $\{0, 3, 5, 6\}$ = $01101001$

- Operations

- `&` Intersection

- `|` Union

- `^` Symmetric Difference

- `~` Complement

### Contrast Logic Operations in C

- Contrast to Logical Operators

- `&&`, `||`, `!`

    - View `0` as `FALSE`

    - Anything non-zero as `TRUE`

    - Always return 0 or 1

    - Early Termination

- Example (`char` data type)

- !0x41 -> 0x00
- !0x00 -> 0x01

### Shift Operations

- Left Shift `<<`

- Shift bits to the left

- Fill with 0 on the right

Argument x | 01100010
--- | ---
<< 3 | 00010000
<< 8 | 00000000

- Right Shift `>>`

- Shift bits to the right

- Logical shift

    - Fill with 0 on the left

- Arithmetic shift

    - Replicate most significant bit on left

Argument x | 10100010
--- | ---
Log. >> 2 | 00101000
Arith. >> 2 | 11101000

## Integers

### Encoding Integers

- Unsigned

- Range $0$ to $2^w-1$

- Two's Complement

- Range $-2^{w-1}$ to $2^{w-1}-1$

### Numeric Ranges

- Unsigned Values

- $UMin = 0$

- $UMax = 2^w - 1$

- Two's Complement Values

- $TMin = -2^{w-1}$

- $TMax = 2^{w-1} - 1$

- Other values

- Minus 1 = All bits set to 1

Values for $w = 16$

- | Decimal | Hex | Binary
--- | --- | --- | ---
$UMax$ | 65355 | FF FF | 11111111 11111111
$TMax$ | 32767 | 7FFF | 01111111 11111111
$TMin$ | -32768 | 8000 | 10000000 00000000
$-1$ | -1 | FFFF | 11111111 11111111
$0$ | 0 | 0000 | 00000000 00000000

Unsigned & Signed Numeric Values

$X$ | $B2U(X)$ | $B2T(X)$
--- | --- | ---
0000 | 0 | 0
0001 | 1 | 1
0010 | 2 | 2
0011 | 3 | 3
0100 | 4 | 4
0101 | 5 | 5
0110 | 6 | 6
0111 | 7 | 7
1000 | 8 | -8
1001 | 9 | -7
1010 | 10 | -6
1011 | 11 | -5
1100 | 12 | -4
1101 | 13 | -3
1110 | 14 | -2
1111 | 15 | -1

### Signed v.s. Unsigned in C

- Constants

- By default are considered to be signed integers

- Unsigned if have "U" as suffix

- Casting 

- Explicit casting betwen signed & unsigned same as U2T and T2U

```c
int tx, ty;
unsigned ux, uy;
tx = (int) x;
uy = (unsigned) y;
```

- Expression Evaluation

- If there is a mix of unsigned and signed in single expression, *signed values implicityly cast to unsigned*

- Including comparison operations `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`

- Examples for $W = 32$: 

    - $TMin = -2147483648$

    - $TMax = 2147483647$

Constant 1 | Constant 2 | Relation | Evaluation
--- | --- | --- | ---
0 | 0U | == | unsigned
-1 | 0 | < | signed
-1 | 0U | > | unsigned
2147483647 | -2147483647 - 1 | > | signed
2147483647U | -2147483647 - 1 | < | unsigned
2147483647 | 2147483648U | < | unsigned
2147483647 | (int)2147483648U | > | signed

|`TMAX`| = |`TMIN`| - 1
`UMAX` = 2`TMAX` + 1

I there is a signed value in it unsigned in any kind of arithmetic will treat it as unsigned

### Expanding, Truncating: Basic Rules

- Expanding

- Unsigned: zeros added

- Signed: sign extension

- Truncating

- Unsigned / signed: bits are truncated

- Result reinterpreted

- Unsigned: mod operation

- Signed: similar to mod

- For small numbers yields expected behavior

### Unsigned Addition

Operands: $w$ bits

True Result: $w+1$ bits

Discard Carry: $w$ bits (ignore $w+1$ th bit)

- Standard Addition Function

- ignore carry output

- always non-negative

- Implements Modular Arithmetic

- $s = UAdd(x, y) = x + y \mod 2^w$

### Two's Complement Addition

Operands: $w$ bits

True Result: $w+1$ bits

Discard Carry: $w$ bits

- Functionality

- True sum requires $w+1$ bits

- Drop off MSB

- Treat remaining bits as 2's comp. integer

- Positive overflow

    - if $sum \geq 2^{w-1}$

        - Becomes negative

        - At most once

- Negative overflow

    - if $sum < -2^{w-1}$

        - Becomes positive

        - At most once

### Multiplication

If exact results become bigger than $w$ bits:

- Unsigned: up to $2w$ bits

- Result range: $0 \leq x * y \leq (2^w - 1)^2 = 2^{2w} - 2^{w+1} + 1$

- Two's Complement min (negative): Up to $2w-1$ bits

- Result range: $x * y \geq (-2^{w-1}) * (2^{w-1} - 1) = -2^{2w-2} + 2^{w-1}$

- Two's Complement max (positive): Up to $2w$ bits, but only for $(TMin)^2$

- Result range: $x * y \leq (-2^{w-1})^2 = 2^{2w-2}$

#### Unsigned Multiplication in C

- Standard multiplication function

- Ignores high order $w$ bits

- Implements modular arithmetic

- $UMult(x, y) = x * y \mod 2^w$


#### Signed Multiplication in C

- Standard multiplication function

- Ignores high order $w$ bits

- Some of which are different for signed vs. unsigned multiplication

- Lower bits are the same

### Power of 2 Multiply with Shift

- Operation

- $u << k = u * 2^k$

- Both signed and unsigned

Operands: $w$ bits

True Product: $w+k$ bits

Discard Carry: $w$ bits

### Unsigned Power of 2 Divide with Shift

- Quotient of Unsigned by Power of 2

- $u >> k$ gives $\lfloor u / 2^k \rfloor$

- Uses logical shift

### Two's Complement Power of 2 Divide with Shift

- Quotient of Two's Complement by Power of 2

- $x >> k$ gives

    - $\lfloor x / 2^k \rfloor$ if $x \geq 0$

    - $\lceil x / 2^k \rceil$ if $x < 0$

- Uses arithmetic shift

## Representation in memory, pointers, strings

### Byte-Oriented Memory Organization

- Programs refer to data by memory address

- An address is like an index into that array

    - and, a pointer variables stores an address

- System provides private address spaces to each
"process"

### Machine Words

- Any given computer has a "word size"

- But for right, hardware itself doesn't necessarily define what the word size is. It's a combination of the hardware and the compiler that determiens

- most machines used 32 bits (4 bytes) as word size

    - Limits addresses to $2^{32}$ bytes

- Machines still support multiple data formats

    - Fractions or multiples of word size

    - Always integral number of bytes

### Word-Oriented Memory Organization

- Addresses specify byte locations

- Addresses of successive words differ by 4 (32-bit) or 8 (64-bit)

32-bit | 64-bit | Bytes | Addr.
--- | --- | --- | ---
0000 | 0000 | - | 0000
0000 | 0000 | - | 0001
0000 | 0000 | - | 0002
0000 | 0000 | - | 0003
0004 | 0000 | - | 0004
0004 | 0000 | - | 0005
0004 | 0000 | - | 0006
0004 | 0000 | - | 0007

### Representing Integers

Decimal: $15213$

Binary: 0011 1011 0110 1101

Hex: 3 B 6 D

### Representing Strings

- Strings in C

- Represented by array of characters

- Each character encoded as ASCII format

- Compatibility

- Byte ordering not an issue


# Floating Point

## Fractional Binary Numbers

- Representation

- Bits to right of "binary point" represent fractional power of 2

- Represents rational number  $\sum_{k=-j}^{i} b_k 2^{k}$

    - [$b_i, b_{i-1}, ..., b_0, b_{-j}$]

Value | Representation
--- | ---
3/4 | 0.11
7/8 | 0.111
7/16 | 0.0111
1/3 | 0.010101...
1/5 | 0.001100110011...
1/10 | 0.0001100110011...

- Limitation #1

- Can only exactly represent numbers of the form $x/2^k$

- Limitation #2

- Just one setting of binary point within the $w$ bits

    - Limited range of numbers 

## Floating Point Representation

- Numerical Form:

$(-1)^s * M * 2^E$

- Sign bit $s$ determines whether number is negative or positive

- Significand $M$ normally a fractional value range $[1.0, 2.0]$

- Exponent $E$ weights value by power of 2

- Encoding

- MSB s is sign bit $s$

- exp field encodes $E$ (but is not equal to $E$)

- frac field encodes $M$ (but is not equal to $M$)

[s(1 bit), exp(8/11 bits), frac(23/52 bits)] in 32/64-bit format

### Normalized Values

- When exp is not all ones or zeros

- Exponent coded as a biased value $E = Exp - Bias$

- $Exp$: unsigned value of exp field

- $Bias = 2^{k-1} - 1$ for $k$ exponent bits

    - single precision: 127 (Exp: 1 to 254, E: -126 to 127)

    - double precision: 1023 (Exp: 1 to 2046, E: -1022 to 1023)

- Significand coded with impiled leading 1:M = 1.xxxx

- xxx...x: bits of frac field

- Minimum when frac is all zeros

- Maximum when frac is all ones

- Get extra leading bit for free

- Example

- Value: float F = 15213.0

    - 15213 in binary is $11101101001101$

    - Normalized to $1.1101101001101 * 2^{13}$

- Significand

    - $M = 1.1101101001101$

    - $frac = 11011010011010000000000$

- Exponent

    - $E = 13$

    - $Bias = 127$

    - $Exp = E + Bias = 13 + 127 = 140$ = $10001100$

### Denormalized Values

- Condition: exp = 000...0

- Exponent value: E = 1 - Bias (instead of E = 0 - Bias when exp = 000...0)

- Significand coded with implied leading 0: M = 0.xxxx

- xxx...x: bits of frac field

- Cases

- exp = 000...0, frac = 000...0

    - Represents zero value

- exp = 000...0, frac != 000...0

    - Numbers closest to 0.0

    - Equispaced

## Special Values

- Condition: exp = 111...1

- Case: exp = 111...1, frac = 000...0

- Represents value infinity

- Operation that overflows

- Both positive and negative

- Case: exp = 111...1, frac != 000...0

- Represents Not a Number (NaN)

- Represents case when no numeric value van be determined

- Example

s | exp | frac | E | Value
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
0 | 0000 | 000 | -6 | 0
0 | 0000 | 001 | -6 | 1/8 * 1/64 = 1/512
0 | 0000 | 010 | -6 | 2/8 * 1/64 = 1/256
... | ... | ... | ... | ...
0 | 0000 | 110 | -6 | 6/8 * 1/64 = 6/512
0 | 0000 | 111 | -6 | 7/8 * 1/64 = 7/512
Denormalized numbers | ... | ... | ... | ...
0 | 0001 | 000 | -6 | 8/8 * 1/64 = 8/512
0 | 0001 | 001 | -6 | 9/8 * 1/64 = 9/512
... | ... | ... | ... | ...
0 | 0110 | 110 | -1 | 14/8 * 1/64 = 14/16
0 | 0110 | 111 | -1 | 15/8 * 1/64 = 15/16
0 | 0111 | 000 | 0 | 8/8 * 1 = 1
0 | 0111 | 001 | 0 | 9/8 * 1 = 9/8
0 | 0111 | 010 | 0 | 10/8 * 1 = 10/8
... | ... | ... | ... | ...
0 | 1110 | 110 | 7 | 14/8 * 128 = 224
0 | 1110 | 111 | 7 | 15/8 * 128 = 240
Normalized numbers | ... | ... | ... | ...
0 | 1111 | 000 | n/a | inf

- Properties

- FP Zero Same as Integer Zero

    - All bits

- Can (Almost) Use Unsigned Integer Comparison

    - Must first compare sign bits

    - Must consider -0 = 0

    - NaNs problematic

## Rounding, addition, multiplication 

### Operations

- x + y = Round(x + y)

- x * y = Round(x * y)

- Basic idea

- First compute exact result

- Make it fit into desired precision

    - Possibly overflow if exponent too large

    - Possibly round to fit into frac field

### Rounding

Rounding Modes (illustrate with $ rounding)

- | $1.40 | $1.60 | $1.50 | $2.50 | -1.50 |
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Towards zero | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2 | -1
Round down | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2 | -2
Round up | 2 | 2 | 2 | 3 | -1
Round to nearest even | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | -2

- Default Rounding Mode

- Hard to get any other kind without dropping into assembly

- All others are statistically biased

- Applying to Other Decimal Places / Bit positions

- When exactly halfway between two possible values

    - Round so that least significant digit is even

- Binary Fractional Numbers

- Even when least significant bit is 0

- Half way when bits to right of rounding position = 100...

Value | Binary | Rounded | Action | Rounded Value
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
2 7/8 | 10.11000 | 11.00 | 1/2-up | 3
2 5/8 | 10.10100 | 10.10 | 1/2-down | 2 1/2

### FP Multiplication

$(-1)^{s1} * M1 * 2^{E1} * (-1)^{s2} * M2 * 2^{E2}$

Exact Result: $(-1)^{s} * M * 2^{E}$

- Sign s: s1 ^ s2

- Significand M: M1 * M2

- Exponent E: E1 + E2

### FP Addition

$(-1)^{s1} * M1 * 2^{E1} + (-1)^{s2} * M2 * 2^{E2}$

- Assume E1 > E2

Exact Result: $(-1)^{s} * M * 2^{E}$

- $(-1)^{s} * M * 2^{E}$

## Floating Point in C

- C Guarantees Two Levels

- float: Single Precision

- double: Double Precision

- Conversions / Casting

- Casting between `int`, `float`, `double` changes bit representation

- `double` / `float` to `int`

    - Truncate fractional part

    - Like rounding toward zero

    - Not defined when out of range or NaN: Generally sets to TMin

- `int` to `double`

    - Exact conversion, as long as `int` has $\leq$ 53 bits

- `int` to `float`

    - Will round according to the rounding mode

### Moving Data

- Moving Data

    - `movq Src, Dst`

- Operand Types

    - Immediate: Constant integer value

        - Example: `$0x400`, `$-533`

        - Encoded with 1,2, or 4 bytes

    - Register: One of 16 integer registers

        - Example: `%rax`, `%r13`

    - Memory: 8 consecutive bytes of memory at address given by register

        - Example: `(%rax)`

### `movq` Operand Combinations

source | dst | Assembly | C Analog
--- | --- | --- | ---
Imm | Reg | `movq $0x123, %rax` | `t = 0x123`
Imm | Mem | `movq $-147, (%rax)` | `*p = -147`
Reg | Reg | `movq %rax, %rdx` | `temp2 = temp1`
Reg | Mem | `movq %rax, (%rdx)` | `*p = temp`
Mem | Reg | `movq (%rax), %rdx` | `temp = *p`

## Arithmetic & logical operations

### Address Computation Instructions

- `leaq Src, Dst`

    - Src is address mode expression

    - Set Dst to address denoted by expression

- Example

```c
long m12(long x) {
    return x + 12;
}
```

Converted to ASM by compiler:

```assembly
leaq (%rdi, %rdi, 2), %rax # t = x + (x*2) = x*3
salq $2, %rax              # t <<= 2 = t*4
ret
``` 

### Some Arithmetic Instructions

- Two operand Instructions:

Format | Computation
--- | ---
`addq Src, Dst` | Dst = Dst + Src
`subq Src, Dst` | Dst = Dst - Src
`imulq Src, Dst` | Dst = Dst * Src
`salq Src, Dst` | Dst = Dst << Src
`sarq Src, Dst` | Dst = Dst >> Src
`shrq Src, Dst` | Dst = Dst >> Src
`xorq Src, Dst` | Dst = Dst ^ Src
`andq Src, Dst` | Dst = Dst & Src
`orq Src, Dst` | Dst = Dst | Src

- One operand instructions:

Format | Computation
--- | ---
`incq Dst` | Dst = Dst + 1
`decq Dst` | Dst = Dst - 1
`negq Dst` | Dst = -Dst
`notq Dst` | Dst = ~Dst

#### Example

```c
long arith(long x, long y, long z) {
    long t1 = x + y;
    long t2 = z + t1;
    long t3 = x + 4;
    long t4 = y * 48;
    long t5 = t3 + t4;
    long rval = t2 + t5;
    return rval;
}
```

```assembly
leaq (%rdi, %rsi), %rax # t1
addq %rdx, %rax # t2
leaq (%rsi, %rsi, 2), %rdx
salq $4, %rdx # t4
leaq 4(%rdi, %rdx), %rcx # t5
imulq %rcx, %rax # rval
ret
```

Register | Uses
--- | ---
%rdi | x
%rsi | y
%rdx | z
%rax | t1, t2, rval
%rdx | t4
%rcx | t5

Register is not part of memory also not port of cache

## Control: Condition codes

### Processor State

- Information about currently executing program

    - Temporary data `%rax`

    - Location of runtime stack `%rsp`

    - Location of current code control point `%rip`

    - Status of recent tests (`CF`, `ZF`, `SF`, `OF`)

### Condition Codes

- Single bit registers

    - Example: `addq Src, Dst` <-> `t = a + b`

    - CF: Carry Flag (for unsigned)

        - set if carry out fron most significant bit (unsigned overflow)

        - if think of adding two numbers, think of them as two unsigned numbers. And do the binary arithmetic and sometimes an extra one pops out of the left hand side, that's what the carry flag is.

    - ZF: Zero Flag

        - set if `t == 0`

    - SF: Sign Flag (for signed)

        - set if `t < 0` (as signed)

    - OF: Overflow Flag (for signed)

        - set if `t` overflows (signed) overflow

        - `(a>0 && b>0 && t<0) || (a<0 && b<0 && t>=0)`

- Explicit Setting by Compare Instruction

    - `cmpq Src2, Src1`

        - `cmpq b, a` like computing `a-b` without setting destination

- Explicit Setting by Test instruction

    - `testq Src2, Src1`

        - `testq b, a` like computing `a & b` without setting destination

- Reading Condition Codes

    - Setx Instructions

        - Set low-order byte of destination to 0 or 1 based on combinations of condition codes

        - Set single byte based on combination of condition codes

        SetX | Condition | Description
        --- | --- | ---
        `sete` | ZF == 1 | Set if equal
        `setne` | ~ZF | Set if not equal
        `sets` | SF == 1 | Set if negative
        `setns` | ~SF | Set if not negative
        `setg` | ~(SF ^ OF) & ~ZF | Set if greater
        `setge` | ~(SF ^ OF) | Set if greater or equal
        `setl` | SF ^ OF | Set if  less
        `setle` | (SF ^ OF) | ZF | Set if less or equal
        `seta` | ~CF & ~ZF | Set if above
        `setb` | CF | Set if below

    - Example

    ```c
    int gt (long x, long y) {
        return x > y;
    }
    ```

    ```assembly
    cmpq %rsi, %rdi  # Compare x and y
    setg %al         # Set if x > y
    movzbl %al, %eax # Zero rest of %rax
    ret
    ```

    Register | Uses
    --- | ---
    %rdi | x
    %rsi | y
    %rax | return value
        

## Conditional branches

### Jumping

- JX Instructions

    - Jump to different part of code depending on condition codes

    JX | Condition | Description
    --- | --- | ---
    `jmp` | 1 | Unconditional
    `je` | ZF | Equal/Zero
    `jne` | ~ZF | Not equal/zero
    `js` | SF | Negative
    `jns` | ~SF | Not negative
    `jg` | ~(SF ^ OF) & ~ZF | Greater
    `jge` | ~(SF ^ OF) | Greater or equal
    `jl` | SF ^ OF | Less
    `jle` | (SF ^ OF) | ZF | Less or equal
    
    - Example

    ```c
    long absdiff(long x, long y) {
        long result;
        if (x > y) {
            result = x - y;
        } else {
            result = y - x;
        }
        return result;
    }
    ```

    ```assembly
    cmpq %rsi, %rdi # x:y
    jle .L4
    movq %rdi, %rax # result = x-y
    subq %rsi, %rax
    ret
    .L4: # x<=y
    movq %rsi, %rax # result = y-x
    subq %rdi, %rax
    ret
    ```

    Register | Uses
    --- | ---
    %rdi | x
    %rsi | y
    %rax | result

### Expression with Goto code

- C allows `goto` statement

- Jump to position designated by label

### Using Conditional Moves

- Conditional Move Instructions

    - Instruction supports:
    
        - if (Test) Dest <- Src

    - GCC tries to use them
    
        - But, only when known to be safe

        - Branches are very disruptive to instruction flow through pipelines

        - Conditional moves do not require control transfer
    
    - Example

    ```c
    long absdiff_se(long x, long y) {
        long result;
        if (x >= y) {
            result = x - y;
        } else {
            result = y - x;
        }
        return result;
    }
    ```

    ```assembly
    movq %rdi, %rax # x
    subq %rsi, %rax # result = x-y
    movq %rsi, %rdx
    subq %rdi, %rdx # eval = y-x
    cmpq %rdi, %rsi # x:y
    cmovge %rdx, %rax # if <= result = eval
    ret
    ```
    
## Loops

### "Do-While" Loop

- Count number of 1's in argument x ("popcount")

- Use conditional branch to either continue looping or to exit the loop

```c
while (Test) {
    Body
}
```

### "For" Loop

Geneneral form:

```c
for (Init; Test; Update) {
    Body
}
```
 
## Switch statement

### Switch Statement Example

```c
long switch_eg(long x, long y, long z) {
    long w = 1;
    switch (x) {
        case 1:
            w = y * z;
            break;
        case 2:
            w = y / z;
            /* Fall through */
        case 3:
            w += z;
            break;
        case 5:
        case 6:
            w -= z;
            break;
        default:
            w = 2;
    }
    return w;
}
```

- Multiple case labels

    - Here 5 & 6

- Fall through cases

    - Here 2

- Missing case

    - Here 4

```assembly
movq %rdx, %rcx
cmpq $6, %rdi # x:6
ja .L8 # Use default
jmp *.L4(,%rdi,8) #goto *JTab[x]
```

### Jump Table Structure

Switch form

```c
switch (x) {
    case val_0:
        block_0
    case val_1:
        block_1
    ...
    case val_(n-1):
        block_(n-1)
}
```

| Jump Table | Jump Targets |
| --- | --- |
| Targ0 | Code Block 0 |
| Targ1 | Code Block 1 |
| ... | ... |
| Targ_(n-1) | Code Block (n-1) |

### Assembly Setup Explaination

- Table Structure

    - Each target requires 8 bytes

    - Base address at `.L4`

- Jumping

    - Direct `jmp.L8`

    - Jump target is denoted by label `.L8`

    - Indirect `jmp *.L4(,%rdi,8)`

    - Start of jumb table `.L4`

    - Must scale by factor of 8 (addresses are 8 bytes)

    - Fetch target from effective address `.L4 + 8 * x`

        - Only for $0 \leq x \leq 6$

## Procedures

### Mechanisms in Procedures

- Passing control

    - To beinning of procedure code

    - Back to return point

- Passing data

    - Procedure arguments

    - Return value

- Memory management

    - Allocate during procedure execution

    - Deallocate upon return

- Mechanism all implemented with machine instructions

### Stack Structure

x86-64 Stack

- Region of memory managed with stack discipline

- Grows toward lower addresses

- Register `%rsp` contains lowest stack address

- Last-in, first-out (LIFO)

#### Push

- `pushq Src`

    - Fetch operand at `Src`

    - Decrement `%rsp` by 8

    - Write operand at address given by `%rsp`

#### Pop

- `popq Dst`

    - Read value at address given by `%rsp`

    - Increment `%rsp` by 8

    - Store value at `Dst` (must be a register)

    - Deallocate means to move the stack pointer back

### Passing Control

- Use stack to support procedure call and return

- Procedure call: `call Label`

    - Push return address on stack

    - Jump to `label`

- Return address:

    - Address of the next instruction right after call

    - Example from disassembly

- Procedure return: `ret`

    - Pop address from stack

    - Jump to address

### Passing Data

- Procedure data flow

    - First 6 arguments

    | Register |
    | --- |
    | `%rdi` |
    | `%rsi` |
    | `%rdx` |
    | `%rcx` |
    | `%r8` |
    | `%r9` |

    - Return value

        - `%rax`

### Managing local data

#### Stack-Based Lanuages

- Languages that support recursion

    - e.g. C

    - Code must be "Reentrant"

        - Mutiple simultaneous instantiations of single procedure

    - Need some place to store state of each instantiation

        - Arguments

        - Local variables

        - Return pointer

- Stack discipline

    - State for given procedure needed for limited time

        - From when called to when return

    - Callee returns before caller does

- Stack allocated in Frames

    - state for single procedure instantiation

    - Contents

        - Return information

        - Local storage (if needed)

        - Temporary space (if needed)

    - Management

        - Space allocated when enter procedure

            - "Set-up" code

            - Includes push by `call` instruction

        - Deallocated when return

            - "Finish" code
            
            - Includes pop by `ret` instruction

#### x86-64/Linux Stack Frame

- Current Stack Frame

    - "Argument build:" Parameters for function about to call

    - Local variables if can't keep in registers

    - Saved register context

    - Old frame pointer

- Caller Stack Frame

    - Return address
        
        - Pushed by `call` instruction

    - Argument for this call

#### Example `incr`

```c
long incr(long *p, long val) {
    long x = *p;
    long y = x + val;
    *p = y;
    return x;
}
```

```assembly
movq (%rdi), %rax
addq %rax %rsi
movq %rsi, (%rdi)
ret
```

Register | Uses
--- | ---
%rdi | p
%rsi | val, y
%rax | x, return value

Calling `incr`

```c
long call_incr() {
    long v1 = 15213;
    long v2 = incr(&v1, 3000);
    return v1 + v2; # 15213 + 18213 = 33426
}
```

```assembly
subq $16, %rsp
movq $15213, 8(%rbp)
movl $3000, %esi # 3000 is a small number, so it can be put in 32-bit register
leaq 8(%rsp), %rdi
call incr
addq 8(%rsp), %rax
addq $16 %rsp
ret
```

#### Register Saving Conventions

- When procedure `yoo` calls `who`

    - `yoo` is the caller

    - `who` is the callee

```assembly
yoo:
    ...
    movq $15213, %rdx
    call who
    addq %rdx, %rax
    ...
    ret
```

```assembly
who:
    ...
    subq $18213, %rdx
    ...
    ret
```

- Contents of register `%rdx` overwritten by `who`

- This could be trouble -> something should be done

    - Need some coordination

- Conventions

    - "Called Saved"

        - Caller saves temporary values in its frame before the call

    - "Callee Saved"

        - Callee saves temporary values in its frame before using

        - Called restores them before returning to caller

### Illustration of Recursion & Pointers

#### Recursive Function

```c
/*Recursive popcount*/
long pcount_r(unsigned long x) {
    if (x == 0)
        return 0;
    else
        return (x & 1) + pcount_r(x >> 1);
}
```

```assembly
pcount_r:
    movl $0, %eax
    testq %rdi, %rdi
    je/jz .L6
    pushq %rbx
    movq %rdi, %rbx
    shrq %rdi
    call pcount_r
    addq %rbx, %rax
    popq %rbx
.L6:
    rep; ret
```
#### Observations About Recursion

- Handled without special consideration

    - stack frames mean that each function call have private storage

        - saved register & local variables

        - saved return pointer

    - Register saving conventions prevent one function call from corrupting another's idea

        - Unless the C code explicitly does so

    - Stack discipline follows call / return pattern

        - If P calls Q, then Q returns before P 
        
        - Last-in, first-out (LIFO)

- Also works for mutual recursion

    - P calls Q; Q calls P
