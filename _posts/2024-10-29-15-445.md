# Rational Model & Algebra

## Data Models

A <span style="text-decoration: underline;">**data model**</span> is a collection of concepts for describing the data in a database

A <span style="text-decoration: underline;">**schema**</span> is a description of a particular collection of data, using a given data model.

## Relational Model

The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">**relational model**</span> defines a database abstraction based on relations to avoid maintenance overhead.

**Structure:** The definition of the database's relations and their contents independent of their physical representation

**Integrity:** Ensures the database's contents satisfy constraints

**Manipulation:** Programming interface for accessing and modifying a database's contents

A **relation** is an unordered set that contain the relationship of attributes that represent entities

A **tuple** is a set of attribute values(aka its **domain**) in the relation

$$n-ary \ Relation = Table \ with \ n \ columns$$

A relation's **primary key** uniquely indentifies a single tuple

A **foreign key** specifies that an attribute from one relation maps to a tuple in another relation

## Relational Algebra

seven primitive operations:

- **Select**
- **Projection**
- **Union**
- **Intersection**
- **Difference**
- **Product**
- **Join**

### Select

Choose a subset of the tuples from a relation that satisfies a selection predicate

- Predicate acts as a filter

- Can combine multiple predicates

Syntax: $\sigma_{predicate}(R)$

### Projection

Generata a relation with tuples that contains only the specified attributes

- Reaarange attributes' ordering

- Remove unwanted attributes

- Manipulate values to create derived attributes

Syntax: $\pi_{A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n}(R)$

### Union

Generate a relation that contains all tuples that appear in either only one or both input relations

Syntax: $(R \cup S)$

### Intersection

Generate a relation that contains only the tuples that appear in both input relations

Syntax: $(R \cap S)$

### Difference

Generate a relation that contains only the tuples that appear in the first and not the second of the input relations

Syntax: $(R - S)$

### Product

Generate a relation that contains the all possible combinations of tuples from the input relations

Syntax: $(R \times S)$

### Join

Generate a relation that contains all tuples that are a combination of two tuples with common values for one or more attributes

Syntax: $(R \bowtie S)$

### Extra operators

- **Rename**

- **Assignment**

- **Duplicate Elimination**

- **Aggregation**

- **Sorting**

- **Division**
