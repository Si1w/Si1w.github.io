# Invitation
When project managers need to invite team members to the Isambard platform, please use school login email addresses (e.g. k1234567@kcl.ac.uk), otherwise the invited members cannot access the platform.

# SSH Connection

Before connecting to Isambard via ssh, please make sure you setup the UNIX name in Isambard portal and setup the [clifton](https://github.com/isambard-sc/clifton/releases/tag/0.3.0)

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/isambard-sc/clifton/releases/latest/download/clifton-linux-musl-x86_64 -o clifton
chmod u+x clifton
```

First we need to use clifton to authenticate the ssh key:

```bash
clifton auth
```

After authentication, we can find the related project IDs under the QR code on terminial

```bash
Successfully authenticated as <email_address> and downloaded SSH certificate for projects:
- <project_id>
```

Then we can use the project ID to connect to Isambard via ssh:

```bash
ssh <project_id>.aip2.isambard
```

# Common Commands

1. Connect to a GPU node for 1 hour and get an interactive bash shell:

```bash
srun --gpus=1 --time=00:01:00 --pty bash
```

Optional: We can set the OpenBLAS number of threads to avoid overloading the CPU:

```bash
export OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=64
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=64
export MKL_NUM_THREADS=64
export NUMEXPR_NUM_THREADS=64
```

2. Submit a batch job using a SLURM script:

```bash
sbatch <script_name>.slurm
```

Example SLURM script (`example.slurm`):

```bash
#! /bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=example_job
#SBATCH --output=example.out
#SBATCH --gpus=1
#SBATCH --time=00:01:00

source /home/<project_id>/<UNIX_name>.<project_id>/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
conda activate example_env

python example.py
```

When setup a conda environment, if it need to use PyTorch or something similiar, please make sure to install these packages individually instead of using `pip install -r requirements.txt`, otherwise it may download the CPU version if no GPU connection is detected.

The example to install PyTorch with GPU support:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
srun --gpus 1 python3 -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"
True
```

3. Check the status of your jobs in the queue:

```bash
squeue -u $USER
```

4. Cancel a job using its job ID:

```bash
scancel <job_id>
```
